  C. Train the model with those images (class = 'YES') and some images that is not your face (class = 'NO')
  D. Convert the model output (.h5) into .mlmodel 
  E. import it into your Xcode for Production.

  A. Take image from Camera
  B. Give the image to CNN for calssification.
  C. If it's you then "Successful Log in"
